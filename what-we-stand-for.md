# What We Stand For

We seek to build a company and culture of ethical innovation. The following is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of core values, rather, it is a selection of the guiding principles that our team will embrace in order to succeed.

### Integrity

Do the right thing. Think of the people we strive to help, and ensure our actions align with their best interests. An example is our belief in the right to personal data autonomy, which underlies our decision to never sell personal data to third parties.

Put science first and invest in improving lives over our bottom line. If valid research demonstrates that one of our products is not helping people, change or remove the productâ€”regardless of how well it sells.

### Ownership

Be fully accountable for responsibilities and manage them through to completion. Help others do the same. Support those who seek more responsibility and correct those who avoid it or shift blame.

### Openness

Embrace evidence, learn from failures, accept criticism, and be prepared to change opinions. Uphold intellectual honesty and avoid dogma.

To ensure communication is effective and inclusive, speak openly and in simple language. Minimize industry jargon and acronyms to establish an environment within which everyone can understand and be understood.

### Boldness

Consider how things should be, rather than how they are, then make it so. Take justifiable risks and meet challenges with determination.

Bias toward action - pursue progress over perfection.

### Intentionality

Practice what we teach. Maintain a balanced lifestyle, foster mental and physical health, and influence those around you to do the same.
