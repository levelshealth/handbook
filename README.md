# Levels Handbook

This is the handbook that we use to bring on all new Levels employees. The contents are heavily influenced by the handbooks by [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/README.md), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/)â€”each of which we highly recommend checking out separately.

### Contributing

You can also go to [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) and make your edits there. Press "Save", and then "Merge" to commit those changes and push them to GitHub.

### Deployment

This is hosted using [GitBook](https://github.com/levelshealth/handbook/tree/d79797baef86116991356b0f06ffbe0aaf71cb79/gitbook.com) and is automatically updated when the Markdown files are changed and merged into the `master` branch.
