# Levels Handbook

This is the handbook that we use to bring on all new Levels employees. The contents are heavily influenced by the handbooks by [Basecamp](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook/blob/master/README.md), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/)â€”each of which we highly recommend checking out separately.
